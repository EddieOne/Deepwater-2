Deepwater-2
===========

Deepwater is a framework that gives projects the ability to create websites rapidly. It handles startup tasks so from day one adding custom functionality 
is the focus. The workflow of Deepwater emphasizes flexibly, speed, and security. Once installed, it is possible to create a new page in minutes without 
needing a text editor or a way to upload files. Deepwater shortens development cycles by providing a toolset for a new or growing project.
